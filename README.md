# Global-terrorism
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

# Explore and analyze the data to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities.

Abstract: With details on various dimensions of each attack, the GTD familiarizes analysts, policymakers, scholars, and journalists with patterns of terrorism. The GTD defines terrorist attacks as: The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.

# Terrorism Definitions
## International terrorismï»¿:
Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with, designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations (state-sponsored).

## Domestic terrorism:
Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.

Many factors have contributed to the evolution of the terrorism threat on both the international and domestic fronts, such as:
### Lone offenders:
Terrorist threats have evolved from large-group conspiracies toward lone-offender attacks. These individuals often radicalize online and mobilize to violence quickly. Without a clear group affiliation or guidance, lone offenders are challenging to identify, investigate, and disrupt.

### The Internet and social media:
International and domestic violent extremists have developed an extensive presence on the Internet through messaging platforms and online images, videos, and publications. These facilitate the groupsâ€™ ability to radicalize and recruit individuals who are receptive to extremist messaging.

# What can we do about it? Clean and understand.ðŸ’¥
Simple. Our goal is to define ways to interpret and understand this information/data and present reasonable findings that might help alleviate the issue more. We can use our own form of helping through analysis and discussion.
